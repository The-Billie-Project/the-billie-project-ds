        "The lyrics to this song were written at an unknown time likely between the 1940 and 1967 by Woodie Guthrie.  Guthrie never recorded or wrote music for these lyrics. His estate approached Billy Bragg and Wilco about writing and recording what would otherwise have been lost works.",
        "They tell the story of a weary Oklahoma during the dust bowl era.  He is dreaming of moving himself and his family to California, where he can rest his head and look up at the stars."
