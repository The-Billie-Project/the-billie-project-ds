        "White Wedding is the second track on Billy Idol’s self-titled album, “Billy Idol”. Released as a single on October 23, 1982, the song reached #6 on UK’s singles chart and #36 on the US Billboard Hot 100.",
        "It is one of Billy Idol’s most recognizable songs despite not being the highest charting song.",
        "According to guitarist, Steve Stevens, the introductory arpeggio riff was inspired by Sergio Leone’s “Spaghetti Western” movie soundtracks of the 1960s."
