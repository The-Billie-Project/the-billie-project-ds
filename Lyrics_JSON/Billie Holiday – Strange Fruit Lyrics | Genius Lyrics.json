            "Pastoral scene of the gallant south",
            "The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth",

    "Comments": [
        "This song, written by Abel Meeropol and performed by many artists (but most notably, Billie Holiday and Nina Simone,) is a dark and profound song about the lynching of African Americans in the Southern United States during the Jim Crow Era.  In the lyrics, black victims are portrayed as “strange fruit,” as they hang from trees, rotting in the sun, blowing in the wind, and becoming food for crows upon being burned.",
        "It was a protest song that Billie Holiday very bravely performed under grave threats and at high personal cost.",
        "This song was covered by Nina Simone, whose version was later sampled on Kanye West’s “Blood on the Leaves” featured on his 2013 release Yeezus.",
        "Also sampled on Abdallah’s “1435” track."
