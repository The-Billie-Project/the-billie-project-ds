I was driving down the 2 back to my house, and it’s a very kind of quiet freeway. It just turns around a mountain. I remember just having that quiet when I’m coming home, and I’m on my own. “I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.” When you’re the one putting an end to something, and you’re not actually happy about it, you’re not enjoying it, but you feel compelled to for some reason.

I’m going to make the music I want to make, and if people like it, then they like it. If they don’t, then they don’t.” Before it was even taken off the country charts, I was just happy to be on Billboard at all. Even after they did take it off, I was like, “Okay, at least I’m still on Billboard.” Then, I started to think about, I was like, “Why?” After listening to other songs that’s actually on that chart, it’s like, “Wait a minute, something’s not right, basically.” Then it felt amazing to get support from country stars because it’s like this is their lane.

I know their most popular hits, something like that. I know “Closer,” I know “Hurt.” Honestly, it makes me feel great that I was able to put completely different worlds together and make a song that so many people like. Almost everybody who I’ve shown this song to, even people commenting comments like, “Hey, I hate this genre and that genre, but I like this song.”\",\\n        \"I released the song literally hours after I was finished in the studio. I couldn’t wait to put it out. I started pushing it on my Twitter account through memes. I was pushing it on my account for I guess a few months until it finally picked up on TikTok. Then, I didn’t have to do much after that because it’s been skyrocketing ever since to this day. One of the biggest memes was like this guy standing on a horse, and he’s riding it through some desert or something. Even Bleacher Report, they took that and they edited it.

I started to live with my sister because I didn’t want to go back home because my parents was not gonna be having that. For one, they feel like music is not a realistic future for anybody. I was living with my sister, and she was ready for me to go, basically. It started off as this loner cowboy kind of vibe. It’s like running away from everything, basically. I found the beat in late October on YouTube and released the song early December. It was gonna be a serious kind of song with country influence, of course. A lot of my music before “Old Town Road,” I was just trying to make music I thought everybody wanted. I changed the meaning of it later on down the road from a runaways type of story to Old Town Road being a symbol for a path of success, where you’re just staying on it. The horse, me not having too much to work with, but getting to where you’re trying to go. It’s like, “I’m gonna take my horse to the old town road.” In the first verse, you’re getting everything packed up and ready to go. In the second verse, you’re in that lane now where everything’s going right. In the chorus, the, “Can’t nobody tell me nothin,” it was like a jab to my parents in a way. Wanting me to not really stop doing music, but to get back into school.

With a fusion of alternative rock, new wave, and electronics, the Pumpkins stumbled upon an atmospheric sound that seemed to define a generation.  At the time of the release, this track sounded much different than anything the industry had ever heard before. “1979” was the last song recorded for Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Billy Corgan believed it belonged on the album, and after being told an earlier version of it wasn’t good enough, revamped it in about four hours, eventually to his producer’s approval.\",\\n        \"The song is one of the band’s most popular and successful. Influential online magazine Pichfork ranked it as the 21st best song of the 1990s. In 2012 Rolling Stone readers voted it the second best Smashing Pumpkins song, with the publication calling it a “wistful pop hit.” The song was also nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Group or Duo at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, and its corresponding music video won “Best Alternative Video” at the 1996 MTV Music Video Awards.\",\\n        \"Billy Corgan doesn’t make a habit of explaining his lyrics.  He prefers not to as he believes it takes away from the song.  He would rather us all interpret his words the way we wish, tailoring them to suit our own situations.  Has has however made some vague comments regarding the lyrics:\",\\n        \"Somehow the lyric, which sings of an opposing sensuous world, balances all of my life on the head of a pin.\",\\n        \"He’s actually just humming and making random sounds that were then electronically processed.  He was asked this question in a magazine interview shortly after the song was released:\",\\n        \"The most frequently asked question about “1979” is, “What is the `ooh-ahh-ahh\\' sound at the end of every phrase?” Flood and I were tracking the song, and I started humming the “oohs” like a melody line. I sang them to tape, we sampled the pertinent ones, electronically manipulated them, and looped them against the drum beat.\",\\n        \"Jimmy Chamberlin did play live drums during the recording of “1979,” but not in the traditional way a drummer may be used to.  He explained the process to Modern Drummer magazine in 1996:\",\\n        \"Another different song for me was “1979,” which is a drum loop with me playing over the top of it. That’s the first time I’ve ever done anything like that.\",\\n        \"In 1996, Billy Corgan spoke about the making of “1979” to Guitar School:\",\\n        \"It was the last song [written for the album]… I demoed out the basic music for “1979,” and we practiced it a few times. Flood wanted to take the tune off the board so we wouldn’t spend more time on it, but I said, “Let me have one more day.” I went home and wrote the whole song that night, words and everything. The next day I came in, played the new demo for him, and he said “That’s it! It’s done!” That demo is still floating around somewhere, and it’s pretty damned weird.\",\\n        \"“1979” has a real immediacy to it; there’s just something about the riff and the vocal. The singles are always like that, though. They come to you pretty fast. It’s funny, because that melody is the very first melody I sang against the riff. Sometimes I have to “mine” the melody; you have to dig around until you find something good and solid, like “Today” and “Disarm” [from Siamese Dream]. Those were the first melodies I ever sang against the chords. And when you find melodies like that, everything seems to just fall into place effortlessly. It’s as though the song is already written, and you’re just trying to find the thread. It’s a weird feeling when you hit upon that. \\\\\"\",\\n        \"It seems very wrong to reduce an important band’s highest-charting single to one sound, but sorry, that whooshing progression that repeats through “1979” is amazing enough to hang a whole career on. That floating guitar figure seems to hold all the wistfulness, sadness, hope, and redemption that the Smashing Pumpkins wanted to get across in the 1990s, and everything else– and they released a ton of great music then, don’t let the last 10 years obscure that – was pretty much gravy. Somehow that riff and the song’s title – ‘79 was a pivotal year for Corgan’s generation, signaling the end of the last decade that would be spent only in childhood – must have motivated Billy Corgan to speak in straightforward and human terms. Here he wasn’t whining, he wasn’t throwing a tantrum, he didn’t want to be the voice of a generation or be someone’s therapist. Instead, he put together a cluster of images that was more about an undefined feeling than a message, and it happened to be the most universal sentiment he’d ever manage. “1979” was Billy Corgan asking, “You know this feeling?” and the second you heard that guitar line the immediate answer was, “I do – tell me more.”\",\\n        \"—Mark Richardson, for Pichfork\"\\n    ],\\n    \"Title\": \"The\\xa0Smashing Pumpkins – 1979 Lyrics | Genius Lyrics\",\\n    \"Release date\": \"January 23, 1996\"\\n}',\n",

a song was created in 1989, when Joel turned 40. The idea spawned from a conversation he had with a friend of Sean Lennon. The friend just turned 21 and was complaining about how crazy it was to be living in his era, therefore undermining any other time before his. This encouraged Joel to write a song that would prove that any time is filled with extremes.\",\\n        \"Starting from 1949 (the year in which he was born), he chronicled the major events that occurred during that time in a rapid fire delivery of names, places, and cultural works.\",\\n        \"These are his words on the subject:\",\\n        \"I started doing that as a mental exercise. I had turned forty. It was 1989, and I said, “Okay, what’s happened in my life? I wrote down the year 1949… It was kind of a mind game. [It’s] one of the few times I’ve written the lyrics first, which should be obvious to why I usually prefer to write the music first, because the melody is horrendous. It’s like a mosquito droning. It’s one of the worst melodies I’ve ever written. I kind of like the lyric though.\",\\n        \"Passage taken from the book, In Their Own Words by Bill DeMain (Chapter 14) where he interviewed Joel about his thoughts on the song.\",\\n        \"The song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a radio mainstay.\",\\n        \"“We Didn’t Start the Fire” is a constant reminder that no matter how crazy times may seem today, they have always been crazy and will continue to be crazy as long as life continues to exist.\",\\n        \"It is a time capsule of political and cultural events that enlighten the listener to the moments that shape Billy Joel’s perspective of the world.\",\\n        \"Particularly striking is the pattern of events that succeeded World War II and led through the beginning, middle, and end of the Cold War. There are constant reminders that a devastating nuclear war threatened large populaces on the planet and though you yourself may live in a time of turmoil and struggle, Billy Joel plants the chronological stake that claims his formative years were shrouded by the universal acceptance of legitimate fears of the end of the world.\",\\n        \"Billy Joel has openly admitted that the structure of the song is basic and not up to par with most of his work. The song is performed with common instrumentation found in 1980’s pop rock. Bass guitar and drums maintain rhythm in the verses while synths and background vocals adorn the choruses. There are very few moments where Billy Joel’s vocals are silent, and this, as well as the uncharacteristically simple song structure, may have much to do with the focus of the song being the lyrics, almost exclusively. There is, however, a harmonic strategy that is rarely performed in covers and even in live versions of the song, and it leaves the song bereft of a major impact in its absence.\",\\n        \"“Cadence” is a musical term referring to a series of notes that end a musical phrase. A cadence can be either open or closed. You can think of an open cadence in music as a person pushing a boulder up a hill, and closed cadence is the relief of pushing the boulder down the other side. A musical example is in the Isley Brothers\\' “Shout” where the gospel jubilation of the rhythm is interrupted by a moment of soulful confession. The last note of the confession is held for an extended period (open cadence) before the excited gospel starts again. The closed cadence appears at the start of the next phrase, acting like an emotional see-saw.\",\\n        \"“We Didn’t Start the Fire” essentially follows the same pattern in the verses where the closed cadence is the start of the phrase and the open cadence can be heard in the rest of the phrase. However, the chorus – which acts like a merciful respite from the relentless bombardment of mementos in the verses – features a steadily played bass line that maintains a constant open cadence. This is accentuated by the fact that the line continues as the song fades out. The emotional result of this arrangement helps solidify the notion that time always moves forward and never stops, and this is especially felt during the lyric, “but when we are gone it will still burn on and on and on…”\"\\n    ],\\n    \"Title\": \"Billy\\xa0Joel – We Didn\\'t Start the Fire Lyrics | Genius Lyrics\",\\n    \"Release date\": \"October 17, 1989\"\\n}',\n",
